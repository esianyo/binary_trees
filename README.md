## Introduction

This project delves into binary trees in C and explores their structure, different types, and associated operations. Binary trees are versatile data structures with many practical uses in software development and algorithm design.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have a deep understanding of the following topics, enabling you to explain them without the need for external resources:

- What is a binary tree?
- The difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- The time complexity advantages of binary trees over linked lists.
- Understanding the depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Various traversal methods to navigate a binary tree.
- Recognizing complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## Requirements

- Editors: Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- Compilation: All code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Line Endings: Ensure that all code files end with a new line.
- README.md: A README.md file must be present at the root of the project folder.
- Coding Style: Your code should adhere to the Betty style, and it will be validated using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Global Variables: You are not allowed to use global variables.
- Function Limit: Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- Standard Library: You can use standard library functions.
- Prototypes: Include function prototypes in the header file named binary_trees.h.
- Header Files: Ensure that your header files are include guarded.

## Data Structures

To implement binary trees, you will use the following data structures:

- `binary_tree_s` for basic binary trees.
- `bst_t` for Binary Search Trees.
- `avl_t` for AVL Trees.
- `heap_t` for Max Binary Heaps.
